Thank you for downloading this asset pack.
(https://pxldev.itch.io/big-32x32-tileset)

- This pack is a "repackaging" of assets made for a game called "No one man" made by Team Melon.
‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗

The original creators of this sprite sheet are (and original roles for the game.):
- Pxl Dev  (Adjusting, editing and adding variations, color grading, new tiles here and there and tinkering with other tiles.)

- Ommtdh   (Creating tiles, helping with color grading and ideation of new tiles, planning what tiles are needed, emotional support.)

- Cherin   (Helped make a couple of new tiles at the beginning helping to define the artstyle.)

- Kapa     (Making the classic decorations, posters and grafitti)

‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗

This repackaging was made by PxlDev. 
- Repackaging includes making more variations to tiles.

- Editing pre-existing tiles to be slightly more generalized. 

- Making some tiles be 32x32 instead of 16x16.

- Adding completely new tiles and making this package itself.
	- "Vegetation" and in "mixed tiles" most of the tiles. (Ommtdh made the original 24 mixed stone tiles on the left.)

- Additional credits:

There was an additional asset pack that was used for a couple of the tiles and slightly changed for the original game. 
Only a couple of tiles are sourced from the original asset pack.
